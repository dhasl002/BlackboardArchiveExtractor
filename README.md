# BlackBoard Archive Extractor

This is the BlackboardArchiveExtractor project for CS411 Team Crystal. At many universities, a web software known as blackboard is used to organize each course. Unfortunately, blackboard only allows teachers to access materials created in the last two years. After two years, the course material is sent to an "archive" that is very diffcult for teachers to access. Team Crystal of CS411 created a software too used to extract these archives and present the old course material in a viewable manner.
